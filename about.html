        <h1><em>Do Not Disturb</em> explores the intersections of online and offline identity.</h1>
        <p style="font-size:15pt;"><em>Do Not Disturb</em>, an ongoing webcomic project, was created as a means to express how our lives are conducted in both physical and digital spaces. When we engage with the Internet, the ways in which we can interact with our environment and ourselves are restrained based on the limitations of the softwares and websites available. This is not necessarily a bad thing; just as we learn how to experience the physical world through the limitations of our own bodies, we learn to manipulate the tools available online to engage in the ways that we want to engage.</p>
        <p style="font-size:15pt;"> Still, it is important to ask: <strong>How are our lives impacted by these invisible, digital structures?</strong> How do these structures change how we interact with others? How we see ourselves? What versions of us are allowed to exist at all?</p>
        <p style="font-size:15pt;"><em>Do Not Disturb</em> follows our protagonist through the late hours of the night as her attention is split between her online and offline worlds. Join us as she fights her way through drama, petty lies, and a chance for redemption, all while she just wants to feed herself and go to bed.</p>
